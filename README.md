# aim65_quartus
This is an alpha release of the AIM65 in an Intel FPGA using the Arrow SocKIT board.<br>
The Arrow SocKIT board is a nearly compatible TerASIC DE10 board where MiSTer runs.<br>
There is a MiSTer port on the Arrow SocKIT here, and as I have a SocKIT board I used their templates.<br><br>
Behind the templates the structeure seems to me very similar, so probably a port on the MiSTer board should be relatively easy, but I don't have such board.<br><br>
